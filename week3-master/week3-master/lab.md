# Week 3 - Lab

### Instructions

Find a product online that you want to sell. Construct a single web page to sell that product.

Your page should:

1. Use Bootstrap
2. Use the Bootstrap Grid so that the design is responsive to different devices
3. Have a navbar at the top (show at least three links)
4. Have a Jumbotron below the navbar
5. Describe the product using a 3-column design

As a bonus, consider using [cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) or
[cards with image caps](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#image-caps).

Happy coding!
