    <p>
      This is something I got as a mint condition back in 2014. It was originally maded in 2004 but when I first bought it at a parking lot, it was almost as brand new. This has been my main guitar ever since.
      A lot of my favorite musicians, including Slash, Jimmy Page, Joe Perry and Gary Moore, use Les Paul as well. Therefore, to play the songs that I like, buying a Les Paul was only logical.
      I just love the color scheme on this one - black and gold.

    <h2>James Tyler Studio Elite HD-P "Holy Shmear"</h2>

    <p>This is also very special guitar for me. I actually sold this before coming to Kellogg because I could not play or bring all the guitars to Evanston. And then I contacted the buyer last month and brought it back from Korea recnetly.
      There are only 5 guitars out there that has this unique "Holy Shmear" finish becuase James Tyler had only limited run. This guitar was built almost like a Fender strat in terms of the pickup configuration and electronics, but has more fat mid to the tone, which makes this really powerful sounding axe.
      I have bought and sold so many guitars over the 10 years but I feel like this one is a definitely a keeper.

    <h2>ESP Horizon Standard FR2</h2>

    <p>This is not one of those boutique guitars that I have collected, but I decided to keep it because this is my first guitar.
      Back in 2007, when I was trying very hard learning songs from Metallica, this one caught my eye. Metallica is the endorser of ESP and both Kirk and James were playing ESP guitars.
      That's literally the only reason why I bought this. I think it is a very stupid reason to spend more than $1,000 on something you don't know how to use, but I was so happy back then.
      Soon I found out I need a lot more than just a guitar to play and sound like Metallica. I though of selling this several times, espeically because I don't really need another metal guitar but I just keep it for the sentimental value.
