    <p>
      This beautiful axe is from Jackson Customshop, which swept the 80's glam metal scene with Soloist and Dinky models.
      I've always wanted to have a tiger-striped guitar and I got this especially for the show that my band had back in May 2015.
      The stage presence, gain, tone and everything else was great but the only problem was that I had so many metal guitars.
      Also, I realized I don't look that cool like those hair metal bands from 90's without the spandex and outrageous hairstyles.
      I had to let this one go to a guy who gives guitar lessons for living.

    <h2>Suhr Custom Modern "Frost Drip"</h2>

    <p>John Suhr from California makes great guitars. He used to work for Fender Customshop back in the days. This particular one is custom Modern model with HSH (Aldrich-ML-Aldrich) pickups and finished unique painting called "Frost drip".
      I still remember the day when I went to the guitar shop in Gangnam area in Korea, tried it for a few minutes and made my decison.
      It was the first time I bought a new guitar from a guitar shop and it was ridiculously expensive. (I usually buy mint condition used guitars)
      I bought this because of the finish but soon I got bored with it and sold it to a mid-40 guy who claimed to be a professional player.
      I don't know why I sold it or bought it from the first place. I think we were just not meant to be.

    <h2>James Tyler Studio Elite HD <br> "Alien Guano"</h2>
    <img src="pictures/JTA.jpg" alt="Responsive image" class="img-responsive"

    <p> I think I was a little too bored with my life when I first saw this on the internet. I love the brand, the model and the finish but I really did not need another guitar at that time. Everything was just so spontaneous.
      It was Sunday 11pm and when I texted the seller, he said he would meet me at the halfway and take about $300 off. (He lived at the South end of Korea, which was about 5-6 hours away by car)
      I hit the road right away. We met at the gas station by the highway. I bought it. I drove home and it was already 3am in the morning and I had to go to work in 3 hours.
      So I decided to play guitar for 2 hours, take shower and go to work the next morning.
      I went through all that trouble buying the guitar but then, a few weeks later, I sold the guitar to another collector.
