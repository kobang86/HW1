            <ul class="text-dark">
            <li> Since middle school, the only kind of music I listened to was classic rock from the 80's and 90's. I didn't really care if people said they were history. I only listened to the classics. Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Eagles, Guns N' Roses, Rammstein and Oasis.
            <br> One day in the winter of 2007, as I was sitting in my room at the Barrack 318, 2nd Infantry Division HQ, Camp Red Cloud, I suddenly decided to start playing guitar.
            <br>From that day, I have been on the constant journey of collecting, buying, selling, trying, experimenting and playing guitars.
            <br> Guitars are wierd in the sense that some vintage actually becomes colletibles and the value increases with time, just like wines. People pay ridiculous amount of money for small differences, such as mojo. Sometimes it's something only the player can notice.
            <br> I see colecting guitar as a hobby, not an investment. For someone like me who still lives and breathes 80's and 90's rock, this is just so fun.
